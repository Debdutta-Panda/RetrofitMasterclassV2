# RetrofitMasterclassV2

Retrofit is a powerful open-source library for Android that simplifies the process of making network requests to web services or APIs. It allows you to define type-safe API calls using annotated interfaces, handles request configuration, response parsing, asynchronous operations, and error handling, making it a popular choice for Android app developers. It is often used in conjunction with OkHttp for efficient and reliable network communication.
