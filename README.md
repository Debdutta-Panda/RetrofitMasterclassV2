# RetrofitMasterclassV2

Retrofit is a powerful open-source library for Android that simplifies the process of making network requests to web services or APIs. It allows you to define type-safe API calls using annotated interfaces, handles request configuration, response parsing, asynchronous operations, and error handling, making it a popular choice for Android app developers. It is often used in conjunction with OkHttp for efficient and reliable network communication.

## Installations
Add the following dependency in module level build gradle file
```
implementation("com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0")
```

## Mechanism
Retrofit streamlines the integration of web services in Android apps, offering a structured mechanism for handling network requests. This organized approach enhances the efficiency and reliability of communication with external APIs, allowing developers to create robust and scalable applications.

1. Create api interface
2. Create retrofit instance
3. Create api service instance
4. Call api
5. Get data

## Api Interface
In Retrofit, the API interface is a fundamental part of defining and structuring your network requests. It's an interface that specifies the API endpoints, HTTP methods, request parameters, and expected response types.
